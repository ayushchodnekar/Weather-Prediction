Using LSTM model to predict temperature using data of previous 3hours.
Long short-term memory networks, or LSTMs, are employed in deep learning. 
Many recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are able to learn long-term dependencies, particularly in tasks involving sequence prediction. 
Aside from singular data points like photos, LSTM has feedback connections, making it capable of processing the complete sequence of data. 
This has uses in machine translation and speech recognition, among others. 
A unique version of RNN called LSTM exhibits exceptional performance on a wide range of issues. 
Using the real-time dataset, the suggested concept is examined.
